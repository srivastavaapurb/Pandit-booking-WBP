### Deploy
1. Create a Hugging Face Space (SDK = Gradio).

3. In **Settings → Variables and secrets**, add:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your rotated OpenAI key (do **not** hardcode).

### How it ranks
Specialization → Proximity (tiers & distance) → Time-window match → Weekday availability → Budget gap → Ratings → Experience → Fee (asc).
